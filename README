This is intended to be a Google Maps mashup with public skating hours for rinks inside 128, with an initial bias towards Belmont / Cambridge / Arlington etc.

But it won't be that for a while.

First step: get the information. There isn't a standard way that this
information is published, so it will be necessary to scrape it from various
sites and manually assemble it.

Second: put it together in a Google Maps setting.
